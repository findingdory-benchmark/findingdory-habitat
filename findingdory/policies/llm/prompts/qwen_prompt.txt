You are an expert and intelligent question answering agent. You will be shown a video that was collected by a robot yesterday while navigating around a house and picking and placing objects. 
Your job is to help the robot complete a task today by looking at the video and finding the frame indices that the robot should move to. Make sure your response is all within the JSON.

Note:
- The robot uses a magic grasp action to pick up an object, where a gripper goes close to the object and the object gets magically picked up.

Output Format (should be in JSON format):
```json
{
  "chain_of_thought": str.
  "frame_indices": list[int].
}
```

Where:
- Chain of Thought: A detailed explanation of the robot's thought process in determining the frame indices.
- Frame Indices: The frame indices in the video stream showing the object or place that the robot should move to. 
  - When deciding which frame indices to choose, make sure you choose the frame indices that are closest to the object/place. 
  - If task requires the agent to go to multiple places, output one frame index per object/place. (Do not use ellipsis)

The robot's goal is: {goal}
